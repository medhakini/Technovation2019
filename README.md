# Santé

INTRO:
This Android app was created as a submission for the 2018-2019 Technovation Challenge by the Binary Buds, Kalie Ching and Medha Kini.

SUMMARY:
The Binary Buds’ app, Santé, was created in order to provide an easy and safe method for people of all ages to be aware of what the medicine they consume contains and understand how much to take. Our application allows consumers to scan a QR code label on a medicine bottle in order to obtain information about its purpose, ingredients, possible allergens, and dosages. The app can then speak this text out loud to ensure that the medicine consumer can hear and understand the details about the pills they are purchasing. On top of that, the app also includes a page with directions on how to safely dispose of excess medication as to not create medical waste.
